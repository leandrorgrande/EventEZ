🛠️ Fix Prompt for Replit AI — Event-U
The project is partially functional, but there are critical bugs and missing core features. Please fix the following issues based on what has already been built:

🔧 1. Real-Time Map and Heatmap
The map is not showing up. Ensure that Mapbox (or Google Maps, if you're using that) is correctly loaded and rendered.

Fix the real-time heatmap, which should be based on the active user's geolocation.

📍 2. Connect Events to Google Maps Establishments
When creating an event, the user must be able to select a location using Google Places API.

The selected place should be saved and linked to the event so that it appears on the map with a unique icon.

Each establishment should display a card showing:

Name and category

List of upcoming events at that location

Heat forecast for future dates/times (future heatmap)

🖼️ 3. Event Media Upload
Allow users to upload an image or video when creating an event.

Store the media file (e.g., in Firebase Storage), and display it in the event card or detail view.

🐞 4. Fix "Create Event" Button
The “Create Event” button is currently broken. Fix it so that:

Fields are properly validated

Event data is saved to the database (Firebase/Firestore or PostgreSQL)

The event list and map update after successful creation

👤 5. User Profile
In the profile view, users should be able to edit their basic info and upload a profile picture.

🧭 6. Claim Business Flow
Implement a flow for business owners to claim a venue:

User selects a place from Google Maps

Clicks to request ownership

Enters contact info (name, phone)

System sends a verification and, once approved, gives control over that location’s events

🔮 7. Future Heatmap Logic
Implement the future heatmap calculation using this logic:

js
Copy
Edit
heat_prediction_score =
  (confirmed_users × 1.0) +
  (popular_times_google × 0.8) +
  (event_type_weight)
Suggested event_type_weight values:

Nightclub: 2.0

Bar with live music: 1.5

Fair: 1.0

Small gathering: 0.5

Display the heatmap prediction based on event RSVPs and Google Maps Popular Times API.

🔒 Please keep the current visual layout. Do not add unnecessary UI mockups or visual placeholders.

The main focus now is to make everything functional and properly integrated, especially with Maps, Places, Firebase, and Storage.
