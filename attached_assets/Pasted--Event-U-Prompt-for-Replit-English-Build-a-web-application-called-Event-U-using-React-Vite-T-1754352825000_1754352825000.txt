📜 Event-U Prompt for Replit (English)
Build a web application called Event-U using React + Vite + TailwindCSS, integrated with Firebase and Mapbox.
The app should be simple and focused, with the initial screen showing only a full-screen live heatmap.

🎯 MVP Scope
🌍 Home Screen (Live Heatmap)
Show a full-screen interactive map using Mapbox GL JS.

The heatmap must be fed automatically by users’ real-time mobile location data (even if anonymous).

Each active user = 1 heat point.

Gradient: blue → green → yellow → orange → red.

Add a “Prediction” button (top right) to switch the map from live mode to future heatmap prediction.

Add a filter bar above the map to filter by event type (Clubs, Shows, Fairs, Bars, etc.).

🔮 Future Heatmap Prediction
When the “Prediction” button is clicked, the map displays forecasted heat based on:

Number of check-ins confirmed for upcoming events.

Google Maps Popular Times data for the location.

Suggested formula:

makefile
Copy
Edit
heat_prediction_score =
  (#confirmed × 1.0) +
  (google_popular_times × 0.8) +
  (event_type_weight)
Example weights: Club +2.0, Bar with live music +1.5, Fair +1.0, Small gathering +0.5.

🗓️ Events
Logged-in users can create events.

Event fields: title, location (Google Places API), date, time, type, description.

Events appear on the map with type-specific icons.

Users can confirm attendance → counts toward future heatmap prediction.

👤 Profiles
Regular User:

View map and events

Do check-ins

Create events

Confirm attendance

Have a profile with created and attended events history

Send and receive basic messages between users

Business Owner:

Claim a location via Google Maps

Verification required (phone/email, like Google Business)

Create and manage events for the claimed location

See stats of attendance and live heat for their events

🛠️ Admin Back-Office
Simple dashboard for:

Approving claimed businesses

Moderating reported events

Viewing global stats (active users, check-ins, events)

🔐 Authentication
Use Firebase Auth (Google login).

Not logged in → can only view the map.

Logged in → can create/join events and message other users.

👉 This ensures Replit AI understands the initial screen must be a live heatmap in full screen, not a mockup or decorative UI.
